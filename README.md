# Network Video Recorder
This version of the recorder shall be implemented as C++, shadowing and improving my existing network video recorder, the latter is implemented in Python + OpenCV.

# Specification (netcam-git)
- Resolution: 3840 x 2160 pixels
- Speed: 4 fps
- Prototype: Python 3.9 interpreter + OpenCV 4.6.0.66
- CPU load: 13% (read video camera stream), 17% average (write output from stream to .avi file)
- CPU type: MacBook, 2.5 GHz Qua-Core Intel i7 (mid 2015)

# Targets
- The output files witten by the network video recorder shall be smaller, however having the same resolution as in the Python + OpenCV version.
- The network video recorder shall use less CPU resources, than the Python + OpenCV version.

# Deadlines
- Don't expect this anytime soon, I first need to refresh my C++ skills. 
- The last time I used C++ was in 1995, maybe I will get up to speed some time this year. 
- Deadline: December 31, 2023 (to be on the safe side).
